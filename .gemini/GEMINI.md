## Gemini Added Memories
- Current project state: The `ng-hl7-parser` library is licensed, published to NPM, and the READMEs are updated.
- Current goal: Build the sample application into a Docker image and publish it to Docker Hub.
- Current blocker: The Docker build is failing due to a local environment issue on the user's machine (`No space left on device`).
- Next step: The user needs to resolve the Docker environment issue (free up space, restart Docker). Once that's done, the next action is to run `docker build -t mbrindam/ng-hl7-parser-app .` again.
